## Annotations and their Usages
### Java Annotations
- @SomeName - Interpreted by the Java compiler as an Annotation
```java
@Service
public class HttpService implements RemoteService {
    @NonNull
    private final Integer port;
    @Autowired
    public HttpService(@Qualifier("port") Integer port) {this.port = port;}
    @Override
    Response sendRequest(String req) throws @Critical NetworkException{}
}
```
### Annotation Meaning and Functionality
- Annotation itself doesn't have any functionality or effect on the program
- It is a way to provide additional information(metadata) about the target it annotates or the program as a whole
- We can think of an annotations as a "comment" but a lot more power
  - We can integrate annotations with the compiler and compile time tools to detect errors, bugs and provide warnings
  - Carry into the JVM and access at Runtime using Reflection

### Annotation Elements
```java
@Component
public class ProductsService {
    @Scheduled(initialDelay = 1000, fixedRate = 60)
    public void reorderProducts() {}
}
```

### Marking Annotations

```java
public class Product {
    @NotNull
    private String id;

    public void setId(String id) {
        this.id = id;
    }
}
```

## Annotations with Java Reflection Motivation
### Annotations and Reflection - Motivation
- Annotations can instruct and direct Reflection code on
  - What targets to process
  - What to do with those targets
- We can decouple our application code from the Reflection code
- We don't restrict our methods/classes/fields to particular
```java
@Component // Considered for auto detection
public class ProductService {
    @Autowired // Dependencies are injected automatically
    ProductService(ProductsDb productsDb, PriceService priceService) {
        
    }
}
```
## Defining our own annotations
Annotation Declaration Structure
```java
@interface Retryable {
    int numOfRetries() default 10;
    long initialDelay() default 10;
    long duration();
    BackoffStrategy strategy();
    String failureMessage();
}
```
### Annotation Element Types
- All Primitive types
- Strings
- Enums
- Classes(Class<?>)
- Other annotations
### Annotations Visibility
- Not all annotations are visible at Runtime
- By default annotations are retained by the compiler at compile time but are ignored by the JVM and are not visible at Runtime
## Meta-Annotations and Java Reflection
### Meta-Annotations
- Meta-annotations - Annotations that apply to other annotations
- Example :
```java
@SomeMetaAnnotaion
@interface CustomAnnotation {
    
}
```
### Retention Meta-Annotation
- One of the most important predefined meta-annotation for us is the @Retention meta-annotation
- The @Retention specifies
  - How a marked annotation is stored
  - For how long it is going to be retained
- @Retention meta-annotation takes a enum value of type RetentionPolicy that has 3 options
  - RetentionPolicy.SOURCE - Annotations are discarded by the compiler
    - Examples : @Override, @SuppressWarnings
  - RetentionPolicy.CLASS - Annotations are recorded in the class file by the compiler but ignored by the JVM at runtime
    - Examples : @AutoValue
  - RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME - Annotations are recorded in the class field by the compiler and are retained by the JVM at runtime

### Retention Policy Example

```java
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@interface RequestValidated {
  Class<? extends Validator> validationClass();

  String validationFailureMessage() default "request rejected";
}
```
### Target Meta-Annotation
- Target meta-annotations limits the targets on which an annotation can be applied
  - ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE
  - ElementType.CONSTRUCTOR
  - ElementType.FIELD
  - ElementType.LOCAL_VARIABLE
  - ElementType.METHOD
  - ElementType.PACKAGE

### Target Meta-Annotation Example
```java
@Target({ElementType.FIELD, 
         ElementType.LOCAL_VARIABLE,
         ElementType.PARAMETER})
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@interface ParamName {
    String value();
}
```
